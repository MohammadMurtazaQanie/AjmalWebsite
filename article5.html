      <h5>Introduction</h4>
        <p class="p1">
          This policy brief is the outcome of a collaborative conversation conducted using Pol.is, an AI-powered
          deliberative technology tool, to get a pulse of youth perceptions about the peace and security issues in South
          Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, North America, and Europe. This policy brief addresses youth
          perceptions of youth-led initiatives vs military actions, youth engagement in policy and action, and the

        <h5 class="p1">Pol.is Deliberative Technology Tool</h5>
        <p class="p1">Pol.is is an open-source tool that allows large groups to share their opinions and ideas and reach better
          decision-making. Unlike traditional surveys with predefined questions, participants can agree, disagree, pass
          on, or suggest their own opinions, which are then shared with others for reactions and comments. Pol.is has
          previously been used to help pass legislation in the United States, Canada, Taiwan, Singapore, the
          Philippines, Spain, and other countries around the world.

        </p>



        <h5 class="p1">Collaborative Conversation Methodology</h5>
        <p class="p1">The collaborative conversation took place in October 2024 using Pol.is based on five Peace Impact Framework
          (PIF) themes: Physical Violence (experiencing direct violence), Personal Agency (trust in society and the
          belief in one's ability to create change), Polarization (people's trust in each other), Institutional
          Legitimacy (people’s trust in institutions), and Resource Investment (long-term investment on peace over
          conflict).</p>
        <p class="p1">A total of 113 youth leaders—representing local organizations focused on youth, women, peace, and security
          agenda—from 42 countries were invited to participate in this conversation throughout a 60-hour timeframe.
          During this period, participants ranked others' opinions by expressing "agreement, disagreement, and
          uncertainty" while adding their own perspectives and first-hand experiences—which were also ranked by others.
        </p>
        <p class="p1">In this collaborative conversation, no personal identifiers were collected, and participants were allowed to
          share their thoughts and opinions in a safe space. This approach allowed for richer and more deliberative
          engagement among the participants, allowing us to gain a better understanding of their true thoughts and
          feelings.
        </p>


        <h5 class="p1">1. The Effectiveness of Youth-Led Initiatives vs. Military Action in Conflict Resolution and Peacebuilding
        </h5>

        <p class="p1">Military action may effectively achieve short-term security goals, but achieving and maintaining peace
          remains in the hands of people, particularly youth, who make up 52% of the global population—with most
          countries in Africa and Asia having over 40% of their population under the age of 20 and over 70% of their
          population under the age of 35.</p>
        <p class="p1">During the conversation, 65% of the participating youth leaders confirmed that "they have seen youth-led
          initiatives being more successful than military action in resolving local conflicts". When asked if "military
          action is more effective than youth-led peacebuilding initiatives in dealing with violent conflicts," 59% of
          participants agreed that military action is indeed effective in dealing with violent conflict. Later, when the
          participants were presented with the statement "peace will never be achieved without military power," 40%
          agreed and 40% disagreed. Seeking their personal experience on the issue, the participants were presented with
          the statement that when they "experienced conflict" in their communities, they did NOT find young people
          "helpful in resolving the conflict," and 59% of the participants disagreed, suggesting that they had seen
          young people being helpful in resolving local conflicts at some point.</p>
        <p class="p1">According to participants of this deliberation, military actions are an effective tool for dealing with
          violent conflicts and short-term security gains. However, the majority expressed that youth-led initiatives
          are more effective in establishing and maintaining peace in those communities—the type of peace and trust that
          all parties will defend, also referred to as Personal Agency in PIF. Therefore, it is critical to recognize
          the influence and impact that young people, both as actors and victims, have on the path toward long-term
          peace and security. Studies show that young people in conflict zones have demonstrated success in peace,
          security, conflict resolution, prevention, and transformation initiatives, despite limited resources. If
          they're provided with opportunities to engage in peacebuilding on a larger scale, their positive impact could
          be significant, as research shows that every dollar invested on youth peacebuilding yields a $5-10 return on
          investment.</p>


        <h5 class="p1">2. The Importance of Youth Participation and Representation in Policy and Action</h5>
        <p class="p2">Youth, both men and women, have a significant impact on peace and security, and their importance cannot be
          overlooked because they are key stakeholders for positive change and sustainable peace. However, if youth are
          not given the right tools, resources, and space to express their creativity, concerns, and hopes, we may end
          up seeing countries further struggle to tackle emerging complex challenges, leading to deteriorating trust in
          institutions, referred to as Institutional Legitimacy in PIF.</p>
        <p class="p3">Young people’s growing mistrust in governance institutions and electoral processes is an important factor
          that affects their political participation. According to UN Secretary-General's 2024 YPS report to the
          Security Council, across 26 countries, 76 percent of young people believe that politicians do not listen to
          them. Unfavorable perceptions of young people harbored by institutions, decision makers and governments
          further deter progress.</p>


        <p class="p4"><strong style="font-weight: bold; color:black;">2.1. Youth-Centered Peace Practice:</strong> Youth-led
          initiatives, particularly social entrepreneurship, have a direct positive impact on preventing polarization,
          conflict and radicalization as well as establishing positive peace in communities. When asked, 68% of
          participants in the collaborative conversation agreed that "most entrepreneurs creating jobs in conflict areas
          are youth" and that their initiatives "boost the economy and contribute to peace".
        </p>

        <p class="p5">This is significant because previous reports and studies indicate, and 62% of our collaborative conversation
          participants agreed, that "most often young people are radicalized into armed groups in the promise of
          material and financial gain" among other factors.</p>
        <p class="p6">Although 75% of the participants in this deliberation agree that "counter-terrorism activities prevent young
          people from joining violent activities", 80% also confirm that "peacebuilding initiatives and funding" are
          effective in "preventing young people from joining groups". The two statements are not paradoxical. While
          counter-terrorism activities are still effective at identifying and apprehending individual perpetrators,
          youth-led initiatives have a broader impact and benefit a larger number of young people, making it one of the
          most effective preventive tools against radicalization and extremism.</p>

        <p class="p7"><strong style="font-weight: bold; color:black;"> 2.2. Unheard Stakeholders:</strong> It is important to note
          that youth participation in practice alone is not enough to enable them to reach their full potential in
          maintaining peace and security. Youth must be involved in policy discussions, including peace talks in order
          to have a say in situations and on issues they inherit. If youth are not given the opportunity to express
          their concerns and hopes, they will feel marginalized and used as a tool for agendas that do not address their
          issues. During this deliberation, 80% of participants agreed that one of "the main reasons formal peace
          agreements in their community broke down was because young people were not engaged enough". This is especially
          true given that youth play multiple roles in times of conflict (from perpetrators to a majority being actively
          involved in peacebuilding activities including influencing peace processes). When young people are ignored by
          institutions, they do not connect with formal peace agreements, viewing them as a power-sharing agreement
          among elites who are disconnected from the people.

        <h5 class="p8">3. Challenges and Barriers Faced by Young Peace-builders</h5>
        <p class="p9">Youth are aware of their responsibilities, and they have proved their role in peace and security. However,
          the challenges they face are enormous, preventing them from having a genuine and long-term impact.</p>

        <p class="p10"><strong style="font-weight: bold; color:black;">3.1. Social Entrepreneurship Eclipse:</strong> Although 91%
          of the conversation participants agreed that "youth social entrepreneurship builds upon peace and security"
          and "solving local issues with sustainable solutions", there is no strategy or national action plan, and
          enough resource investment, to legitimize and anchor these efforts, trapping youth in a cycle where they
          initiate and make efforts, get exhausted, and withdraw. </p>
        <p class="p11"><strong style="font-weight: bold; color:black;">3.2. Donor Disconnect:</strong> 90% of the conversation
          participants agreed that "donors are missing out on opportunities to meet the needs of the community by not
          engaging young people". Donor-grassroots engagement is critical not only because donors are missing out on
          opportunities to leverage the unique insights of young people (as a demographic constituency), but it also
          allows the donors to design programs in ways that take into account important factors that affect program and
          project impact. It also leads to improving institutional legitimacy and trust. 97% of the participants agreed
          that peace and security efforts “need to be sensitive to youth grievances". </p>
        <p class="p12"><strong style="font-weight: bold; color:black;">3.3. Funding Barriers: </strong>Grassroots organizations
          often fail to meet the stringent requirements set by donors. This automatically disqualifies local initiatives
          led by grassroots organizations with innovative ideas, energy, and a desire to contribute to peace, security,
          and development. These local organizations, which are at the forefront of peacebuilding and have the potential
          to make a tangible difference, lack the necessary resources compared to an established organization.
        <p class="p13">The majority of local organizations around the world operate with a budget of $10,000 or less, but they can
          generate a $5-10 return on investment not only for youth, but also for the private sector, local governments,
          and society. Donors have a strong incentive to change their stringent requirements to better support local
          groups, particularly youth-led organizations whose work benefits society writ-large.</p>




        <h5 class="p14">Policy Recommendations</h5>
        <p class="p15">Youth represent both the present and the future. They have a proven impact on peace and security issues and
          an evident five to ten times return on investment; it is now up to the U.S. government to capitalize on this
          opportunity and assist youth in reaching their full potential for the sake of a secure and peaceful world
          consistent with U.S. foreign policy. Addressing the concerns raised by youth leaders and considering their
          perspectives strengthens an America First foreign policy and U.S. national interests in the same way that it
          helps stabilize countries and ensure sustainable peace around the world and reduces the risks of brain drain.
        </p>

        <p class="p16"><strong style="font-weight: bold; color:black;">1. Develop an Inclusive and Cost-Effective Youth, Peace, and
            Security (YPS) Strategy: </strong>The U.S. government should develop an inclusive YPS Strategy as a holistic
          approach to peacebuilding, recognizing the efforts of both young women and young men to promote inclusive
          participation, prevent violence, and foster synergy among youth men and women in parallel, and strengthens the
          U.S. interests abroad. An inclusive YPS Strategy facilitates further collaboration, reduces duplication of
          efforts, and makes better use of resources while addressing multiple dimensions of peace and security. </p>
        <p class="p17"><strong style="font-weight: bold; color:black;">2. Increase Funds for Youth-Led Peace and Security
            Initiatives: </strong> Allocate a portion of military and counter-terrorism funds to youth-led peacebuilding
          initiatives to invest in extremism, conflict and violence prevention, which is less expensive. When supporting
          youth peacebuilding, it is also critical to ensure at least 5% of the programming budget is allocated for
          protection needs to respond to unexpected risks that youth face, including legal and physical violence
          protection. In doing so, the U.S. not only reduces threats to its national security and stakeholders, it also
          improves its image abroad and ensures that its values are upheld. </p>
        <p class="p18"><strong style="font-weight: bold; color:black;">3. Mandate and Support Youth-Inclusive National Action Plans
            for US Tax-payer Recipient Countries:</strong> USAID missions and the Department of State, along with the
          embassies, should coordinate to support country-level national action strategies and plans on Youth, Peace,
          and Security based on the agency’s YPS Strategy (as outlined in recommendation #1). Aligning priorities to
          advance the NAP/Strategies supports cost-effective and efficient ways to achieve national peacebuilding goals.
          It also provides a pathway for youth to have a voice in policy, promotes inclusion, helps donors to better
          allocate funds, strengthens the country's economy, and aligns with international commitments, particularly
          UNSCR 2250. </p>
        <p class="p19">These efforts could be strengthened further by adopting a common framework, based on PIF, to measure the
          progress and impact of YPS NAPs, irrespective of country or issue specificity. This enables the USG to assess
          the extent to which resource investment improves personal agency and institutional legitimacy, and their
          influence on issues like polarization and physical violence.</p>
