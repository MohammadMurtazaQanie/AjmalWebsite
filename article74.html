      <p>
        Outside of the African continent, Afghanistan is the world’s youngest country, with people under the age of 35
        accounting for almost 75% of the population. In Afghanistan, the number of targeted assassinations of youth
        activists, human rights campaigners and journalists in 2020- 2021 was among the highest it’s ever been during
        the war.21 Knowing that there are no mechanisms in place to protect youth activists physically, digitally,
        legally or financially, I, as the founding-member of the National Youth Consensus for Peace, conducted a series
        of immediate training to help protect youth activists, at least physically and digitally.

      </p>
      <p>Physical, digital legal and financial safety continue to be among the most essential considerations for the
        groups of youth activists and human rights defenders with which I’ve worked. Given that we, youth activists,
        journalists and human rights defenders, have been on the frontlines and well- known to the public, our identity
        places us in a dangerous position. There is no national protection framework and, depending on the level and
        form of threats, the issue of protection – whether physical, digital, or legal – differs by region. The state’s
        weakness in the years prior to the Taliban’s 2021 takeover, notably in the security sector, indicated to youth
        activists and journalists just how vulnerable their physical safety was. In particular, targeted assassinations
        (widely believed to be carried out in large part by the Taliban) were one the most challenging issues that
        couldn’t be tackled. Furthermore, no national act existed to shield youth activists and
        civilians from surveillance, hacking and social media-based threats. Above all, the high level of corruption and
        racism in the state, security sector and judicial system made it nearly impossible for Afghan youth activists to
        conduct their activities safely.

      </p>
      <p>The targeted execution of young activists, journalists and human rights defenders is just one of many examples
        of flagrant violations of international human rights and humanitarian law. Other indicators of atrocity seen in
        Afghanistan include corruption and racism, systematic and planned attacks on specific groups of intellectuals,
        and disruption of peace-making initiatives and activities. Following the Doha Agreement between the United
        States and the Taliban on Afghan peace, we saw a dramatic increase in targeted killings of well- known youth
        activists, human rights defenders and journalists in Afghanistan, which has heightened fears among activists.
        Given the unprecedented escalation of unsafe spaces for youth activists, we have tried to create a two-part
        immediate physical and digital security strategy while tirelessly lobbying officials and international
        organizations to develop a long-term, international strategy, and to dedicate funding to protect youth
        activists.</p>
      <p>In the first part of the immediate strategy, we, the National Youth Consensus for Peace, created a basic guide
        for digital protection of young activists while also developing case studies about past targeted executions.
        This was a significant task because information exchange over the internet is not secure. According to our
        findings, the majority of assassination victims were identified and tracked through social media platforms. It
        is also worth noting that government and third-party actors can easily intercept phone calls and even obtain
        access to text messages, documents, and very sensitive personal information about their target’s identity. Our
        digital training introduced strategies for safer email exchange and messaging apps, data and document
        protection, storage of sensitive information such as passwords, the level and type of information safe for
        social media sharing, and how to adjust smartphone settings to minimize third-party access and make the phone
        almost untraceable.
      </p>
      <p>The second part of the immediate strategy focused on activists’ personal physical protection. We instruct
        activists on how to recognize important warning signs, as well as what to do if they realize they are being
        followed or physically attacked. Compared with digital security, physical self-defense and protection was
        difficult to apply practically, but we sought to put lessons acquired into effect by simplifying them while
        preserving the key principles. The question of digital and physical safety is wide-ranging, and a more in-depth
        assessment was required to meet the demands of various types of activists in different locations; however, we
        have included the essential factors pertinent to Afghanistan’s situation. Our mission was to counsel activists
        on how to defend themselves even if the state would not. We emphasized the importance of young activists’
        understanding of their own ability to impact change through action.</p>
      <p>We also lobbied for increased safety measures for youth activists. When we felt that Afghanistan’s government
        and international community were either uninterested in this crucial subject or required extensive investigation
        and analyses on their side, we devised our own method of self-protection. We formed a triangle consisting of the
        state, peace and security specialists, and grassroots-level youth activists. The collective expertise and
        knowledge of this group enabled us to successfully connect the theoretical elements and apply the experiences of
        victims to craft a guide.</p>
      <p>We began developing the guide with the goal of creating a well-structured tool that will provide an immediate
        response to Afghan activists’ issues. Once developed and presented, we had planned to launch a social media
        campaign and petition the UN Youth Envoy’s office to work on a resolution for “Global Legal, Physical, and
        Digital Protection” of young activists as part of the Youth, Peace, and Security agenda. However, due to the
        Afghan government’s collapse in August 2021, we were only able to give a few trainings to four groups of young
        activists. Our initiative was never finalized or presented to Afghan youth activists as a complete guide.</p>
      
        <h5>Recommendations:</h5>
        <h5><i>Focus on what you can do</i></h5>
      
        <p>Despite all of the advancements and human achievements of the twenty-first century, the majority of people continue to struggle to live a safe and normal life. The regulations and practices that were intended to ensure human safety and prosperity are failing miserably. Indeed, rules and regulations are complicating politics and governments to the point where we are failing to achieve our basic goal of protecting human beings. While we still need fundamental reforms and attention in areas such as physical, digital and legal protection of youth activists, human rights defenders and journalists, there are steps that you can take to minimize the negative impact of incidents. Youth groups are creative, capable and committed. They can band together and take steps within their respective circles on almost any issue. Knowing that formal procedures are time-consuming, and that national or international-level outcomes require great effort, youth groups can carve out their own space and discover immediate solutions. The upside of this approach is that youth will be able to lobby with a stronger voice, arguing they have done their part. They can gather knowledge and identify specific issues and obstacles and bypass lengthy procedures.
      </p>
      <p>While all of the regional states have declared that a negotiated peace settlement is their preferred option,
        they all maintain ties to various militias and other armed groups, including the Taliban, in Afghanistan as a
        Plan B. The longer the peace negotiations remain stalled, the greater the danger of regional countries
        defaulting to their Plan B -- potentially turning Afghanistan into a battlefield of proxy wars that history has
        never seen before.</p>

        <h5><i>Find the most effective approach</i></h5>
        <p>Given the breadth and significance of the problem of insecurity, youth groups can devise an effective approach to address it. From the start, all parties must be identified and engaged. We identified and built a triangle of young activists, peace and security specialists, and the security organs of the state as part of our approach. Each of these parties played a unique role and made a significant contribution to our cause. Because they were the principal victims, youth activists and human rights campaigners were crucial. Survivors also had meaningful stories and experiences to share. On the other hand, we had peace and security specialists who were unfamiliar with the on-the-ground realities in Afghanistan but had enough expertise and understanding in the subject to assist in the development of an initial strategic guide. Finally, there was the state, which was in charge of security as well as practical knowledge of the reality on-the-ground. A combination of the youth activists’ needs with the practical knowledge of the specialists and state organs made an effective triangle to design an actionable strategy guide that can respond to immediate needs of youth activists, human rights defenders, and journalists.</p>



        <h5><i>Maintain your emphasis on fundamental change</i></h5>
        <p>While you’re actively working on resolving an issue, don’t forget to advocate harder than ever to encourage policymakers, the international community, and international organizations like the United Nations to take action at a higher level. </p>
        <p>Gaining recognition of the issue from international organizations, leveraging groups who have been trying to solve the issue, and establishing methods as a policy under state and international mandates all contribute to addressing the
          issue in a broader context.
          </p>
